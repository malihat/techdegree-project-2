# List Pagination and Filtering
This project displays a list containing student names, photos and email addresses. The list is paginated by displaying 10 results on a page. The pagination links are available at the bottom of every page so that the user can navigate to any page.

## Skills and techniques required to complete the project 
To build this project, vanilla javaScript was used. The main part of the project was done using functions and loops. The project also covers the theory of unobtrusive javaScript in which the list can also be displayed without javaScript. This is part of the principles of "progressive enhancement" as well.
